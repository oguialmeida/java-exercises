### Just a repository to acquire familiarity with Java programming language.

#### The complexity of the programs are classified in packages inside the source code.

#### I tried to leave the code itself with variables, functions and classes in English, but it is possible that some codes have texts written in Portuguese within the operation of the program itself, as if the USER was expected to understand only Portuguese, but I believe that the code itself is very readable for PROGRAMMERS who understand English, feel free to review and use my codes as you wish :)
